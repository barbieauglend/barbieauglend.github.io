This blog runs on [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), a super easy to use open-source static site generator for people who likes writing in [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

I also would like to thank

* [BJ](https://twitter.com/berendjanwever) for the ASCII art of the banner (that I will return soonish),
* [kylma](https://twitter.com/_kylma) for being the best technical proof reader ever,
* [Cho](https://github.com/pagecho) for the most beautiful design!
